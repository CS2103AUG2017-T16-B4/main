=== Enhancement Added: Mail Command

==== External behavior

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=mailContact]

===== Use Case

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=mailContact]

---



==== Justification
As Contags was developed with working professionals in mind, having a mail command was of very high priority. Mail is the most widely used application by business professionals and according to a study done by The Radicarti Group, the average business professional sends 35 emails a day. Having a mail command integrated into an address book application would be more convenient for users who can find contacts easily and email them.

=== Enhancement Added: Birthday Field

---

==== Justification

Business professionals would find it useful to keep track of their contacts' birthdays so that they can maintain business relationships on top of friendships and family relationships. In today's world where connections are so necessary and powerful, maintaining business relationships have never been more important. Integrating a birthday field as part of a contact's particulars would help users to have a record of their contacts' birthdays and would make it more convenient for users to wish the colleagues and friends.

=== Enhancement Added: ListBirthday Command

---

==== External behavior

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=listBirthday]

---

==== Justification

As mentioned, the birthday field is an important aspect of a contact's particulars due to the strong business relationships it can forge. To make the birthday field more useful, a listbirthday command is also implemented. This command lists the contacts whose birthday fall on that particular day. Users can then easily send them a mail or SMS by typing in the respective commands.
